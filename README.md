### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a strong-willed, supersonic learner ðŸ”­ & an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer ðŸŒ± with strengths in communication and innovative thinking. I execute a growth mindset in my work so that I can grasp & adopt cutting-edge technologies to develop people-centered solutions.

This fall semester, I've taken on a project @ ZCLAP ðŸ’¬ as a Machine Learning intern while pursuing my bachelor's in Data Science @ UT Dallas.
